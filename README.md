# Front End Sample Web Designs

This is a sample bootstap front end framework created using bootstrap 4.

You can download bootstrap from here:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/

For the gallery part for creating albums I have used lightbox. It is better if you link external css and js file from the cdn.
It will reduce load time of the website and improve the performance. However without the internet it will not work.

Here is the link for the css files:
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lightbox2/2.10.0/css/lightbox.min.css

Link for the js files:
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lightbox2/2.10.0/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js

The assets were taken from google images, and their uses have not been violated.
